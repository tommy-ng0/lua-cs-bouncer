# Live mode, CAPTCHA_PROVIDER=altcha, ALTCHA_ALGORITHM=SHA-512, solved for real.
#
# t/25 does this for PBKDF2/SHA-256. ALTCHA_ALGORITHM accepts six values, and they
# split across two branches of derive_key(): three go to one PBKDF2 call, three to an
# iterated digest chain. t/25 covers the first branch and refuses to run against
# anything else, so the second shipped with no end-to-end coverage at all.
#
# The branch is easy to get subtly wrong in ways nothing else would catch. It hashes
# salt||nonce||counter on the first round and the *previous key* on every round after;
# the key is truncated to keyLength inside the loop rather than at the end; and the
# round count is max(1, cost), not cost. Get any of those wrong and every assertion in
# t/23 still passes - a challenge is issued, it is reused per IP, it is unique per IP -
# while no visitor can ever solve it, and the only trace is "Invalid captcha from".
#
# SHA-512, not SHA-256, and that choice is the difference between this file working and
# only appearing to. SHA-256 produces exactly 32 bytes, which is exactly KEY_LENGTH, so
# `key:sub(1, KEY_LENGTH)` is the identity function and moving it out of the loop
# changes nothing an SHA-256 test could observe - the truncation, the most error-prone
# line in the branch, would go unasserted. SHA-512 produces 64 bytes, so the cut is
# real on every round and hashing the untruncated key gives a different answer
# immediately. The widget agrees: its worker reads `keyLength = 32` from the challenge
# parameters and slices each digest to it, whatever the algorithm.
#
# As in t/25 the solver is written from altcha's protocol rather than from altcha.lua,
# so a shared misreading of the spec cannot make both sides agree with each other and
# disagree with the widget.
