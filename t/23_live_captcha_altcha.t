=== TEST 23b: altcha refuses to configure without its shared dict

No crowdsec_altcha dict in this block's http config. captcha.New() has to fail at
init - challenges are attacker-paced writes, and the old fallback let them share
crowdsec_cache with the decision cache they could then evict - leaving captcha
unusable, so the captcha decision for 1.1.1.1 degrades to FALLBACK_REMEDIATION
instead of silently writing challenges next to the decisions.

=== TEST 23c: the mint ceiling is reached through churn and degrades to a ban

MAX_MINTS_PER_WINDOW is 10 per CHALLENGE_TTL, and reloads reuse the outstanding
challenge, so the only way to spend the budget is the challenge going away between
requests - eviction under dict pressure in production, a white-box delete here (the
same trick t/25 uses to read the dict, because eviction cannot be provoked on
demand). The eleventh mint has to be refused and served as a ban, not as a page
whose challenge could never be issued.

=== TEST 23d: the aggregate mint budget refuses a mint but never a reuse

The per-IP ceiling in 23c is keyed on the address, so a rotating source never reaches
it. The aggregate budget is what bounds the total, and it is expressed in blocking
milliseconds per worker-second rather than in mints, so M.New() calibrates it against
a real derivation on this host. At ALTCHA_COST=100 that lands in the thousands, which
is far too many to spend by minting - so the counter is pre-set instead, keyed on the
wall-clock second exactly as Challenge() keys it.

Two things have to hold here, and the second is the reason the check sits below the
reuse fast path rather than at the top of Challenge():

  1. over budget, with nothing outstanding  -> refused, and served as a ban
  2. over budget, with a challenge already outstanding -> still served the widget,
     because handing back an existing challenge costs no derivation and must never
     be refused for want of budget - otherwise a flood locks out the people who are
     already mid-solve

Expiry is deliberately not asserted here. The counter is pre-set, so what expires is
the TTL this block writes rather than the one Challenge() writes, and an assertion that
cannot fail for the right reason is worse than none. 23e drives the real counter.

The budget is armed for a span of seconds rather than just the current one: a request
that landed a second later than the arming would otherwise find a fresh counter and
pass, which is a race rather than a regression.

=== TEST 23e: rotating addresses reach the aggregate budget that the per-IP ceiling misses

23c reaches the per-IP ceiling by minting eleven times as one address. That is the
limit an attacker never meets: a fresh address carries a fresh counter, so ten mints
each from a thousand addresses spends ten thousand derivations and trips nothing. This
block is that attack, and the assertion is that the aggregate budget stops it while the
per-IP ceiling stays untouched - every address here mints exactly once, so if the
per-IP message appears at all, the wrong limit fired.

ALTCHA_COST is at MAX_COST so a derivation is expensive enough for the calibrated
budget to be reachable by minting for real, rather than by pre-setting the counter as
23d has to. That is what makes this the block that can assert expiry: the 2s init_ttl
under test is the one Challenge() writes.

The budget is spent by definition in ~50 ms of derivation per worker-second, so the
loop below costs about that regardless of how fast the host is - a faster host raises
the cap and each mint gets correspondingly cheaper. The bound is derived from the
probed cap rather than hardcoded for the same reason. Firing more than the cap does
not guarantee a refusal on the first pass, because the mints can straddle a second
boundary and land either side of a fresh counter, so the loop keeps going until one
lands.
