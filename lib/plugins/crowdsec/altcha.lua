-- ALTCHA proof-of-work challenges, issued and verified inside nginx.
--
-- Every other provider this bouncer supports answers to somebody else: recaptcha,
-- hcaptcha and turnstile are third-party services, and altcha's own hosted
-- equivalent, Sentinel, is a licensed product. ALTCHA (https://altcha.org) in its
-- free form has no verification service at all - the site is expected to mint and
-- check its own challenges - so the whole exchange fits inside the worker that is
-- already handling the request.
--
-- Protocol (ALTCHA proof-of-work v2, as implemented by the widget's src/pow.ts):
-- we publish a nonce, a salt, a KDF cost and the first half of a key derived from
-- a counter we keep to ourselves. The browser walks counters up from zero, running
-- PBKDF2 over nonce||counter each time, until the derived key starts with the
-- published prefix, then submits the key it found.
--
-- We keep the whole derived key in a shared dict instead of signing the challenge.
-- That buys three things: verification is one string comparison rather than a KDF
-- pass, there is no need to reproduce altcha's canonical JSON byte for byte to
-- check an HMAC, and a challenge is inherently single-use because redeeming it
-- removes it. The cost is that a challenge is only valid on the worker set that
-- issued it, which matches how the bouncer already caches captcha state per node.
--
-- Outstanding challenges are keyed by client IP rather than by nonce. Minting one
-- costs a KDF pass, and the bouncer hands out a captcha page on every request from
-- a challenged IP, so keying by nonce would let anyone already being bounced turn
-- page reloads into arbitrary work for nginx. Keyed by IP, a visitor gets the same
-- challenge back for as long as it is outstanding.
--
-- A challenge is redeemed - removed - only when the answer was right. That is what
-- stops a solution being replayed, and it is the only thing redemption has to do.
-- Destroying it on a wrong answer instead would hand every client a way to clear
-- the entry, so the next page load found nothing outstanding and paid for a fresh
-- derivation.
--
-- Letting wrong answers accumulate is safe, and not for the reason it first appears.
-- The derived key is not a secret: nonce, salt and cost are all published in the
-- challenge, so the only thing withheld is the counter, drawn from about five
-- thousand values at the default ALTCHA_COMPLEXITY. Anyone can simply compute the
-- answer offline - that is the proof of work, and it is what we are asking for. So
-- there is nothing an attacker could learn by submitting guesses that solving would
-- not hand them faster, and a wrong attempt costs far less than the derivation it
-- replaced: a dict read and a fixed-length compare instead of a KDF pass. Not free -
-- the body is still base64-decoded and parsed first, and the captcha page is
-- re-rendered after - but cheaper than what it stands in for. MIN_COMPLEXITY keeps
-- the counter range wide; that range multiplied by ALTCHA_COST, rather than the
-- width of the key, is the quantity that matters.
--
-- One challenge is still shared by everyone behind a NAT. Surviving a wrong answer
-- is what makes that safe: a client submitting junk no longer destroys the
-- challenge its neighbours are part-way through solving. Telling those visitors
-- apart would need per-visitor state this bouncer deliberately does not keep.
--
-- MINT_PREFIX bounds what is left, and refusing to mint past the ceiling fails
-- closed. It is a backstop rather than the primary defence: a client that never
-- solves can force only one mint per window per worker, because the derivation runs
-- to completion without yielding - so requests queued behind it reuse the challenge
-- it writes - and the challenge it would have to clear shares this counter's
-- lifetime. Per worker rather than outright, because a burst spread across workers
-- can have several of them miss the lookup before any completes its write. Note it
-- is keyed on the exact address, so rotating source addresses is how the ceiling is
-- *evaded*, not reached - in practice the way to reach it is challenges being
-- evicted from a shared dict under pressure.

--
-- Deliberately one knob rather than a min and a max. The counter has to be
-- unpredictable: if it were fixed, a client would derive the key in a single pass

--
-- A million is far past anything solvable at a sane cost, so this rejects typos
-- rather than configurations. It also keeps the arithmetic honest, which matters
-- more than it looks: be32() encodes the counter as counter % 2^32, and above that
-- the browser finds a match at the reduced value and submits a key that compares

local CHALLENGE_PREFIX = "altcha_challenge_"
-- Derivations spent by one IP in the current window. Accumulates across mints, and
-- is cleared by a solve or by its own TTL, whichever comes first - so unlike the

-- client that clears the challenge some other way still cannot clear this.
local MINT_PREFIX = "altcha_mints_"

-- How many derivations one IP may spend per CHALLENGE_TTL window before minting is
-- refused. A solve clears the counter, so this only accumulates across challenges
-- that were never redeemed: lapsed mid-solve, backgrounded tabs, stale reloads.
-- Clearing on success matters more than it looks - the appsec path deletes the
-- captcha state rather than storing a window, and CAPTCHA_EXPIRATION can be set
-- shorter than CHALLENGE_TTL, so an honest visitor can legitimately be challenged
-- many times inside one window. Charging them for it would turn a solvable captcha
-- into a ban.
--
-- Ten against the cost of being wrong: at ALTCHA_COST=5000 a derivation is well
-- under a millisecond, so this is a few milliseconds per IP per twenty minutes,
-- while an unbounded count is one blocking KDF pass per request on a worker that
-- cannot yield during it.
local MAX_MINTS_PER_WINDOW = 10

-- The per-IP ceiling above is keyed on the exact address, which is how it is evaded
-- rather than reached: a rotating source gets a fresh counter every time. Nothing
-- bounded the aggregate, and each mint is one blocking, non-yielding derivation on the
-- worker handling it - measured at 0.76 ms at the default ALTCHA_COST of 5000 and
-- 14.2 ms at MAX_COST. OVERRIDE_REMEDIATION=captcha widens who mints from "addresses carrying a
-- captcha decision" to every address in the blocklist that sends a request, so the
-- distinct-address arrival rate is attacker-chosen.
--
-- So bound the aggregate too, and bound it in TIME rather than in mints: a count is
-- meaningless without knowing what a mint costs, and that varies ~20x between the
-- PBKDF2 and SHA families and ~6x with whether the host has SHA-NI. M.New() already
-- runs one real derivation to check the rocks work; timing it converts this into a
-- self-calibrating budget that needs no new config option and no guessed constant.
--
-- 50 ms per worker per second is 5% of each worker spent deriving, so the budget grows
-- with the host rather than being a figure that is generous on 16 cores and crippling
-- on two. Above it, Challenge() refuses, captcha.apply() degrades to ban.apply(), and a
-- flood gets ban pages - the same fail-closed direction the per-IP ceiling already takes.
--
-- What 5% does NOT do is leave the worker idle for real traffic, and an earlier draft of
-- this comment claimed it did. Under a flood the worker saturates either way: measured
-- at 0.90 cores with the budget on and 0.94 without, on one worker. What changes is what
-- the core buys - 2,979 requests a second served instead of 1,030, because a refusal
-- costs a fraction of a derivation - and how long any single operation blocks, which is
-- what keeps the queue behind it short. Treat this as a latency and fairness control,
-- not a capacity saving, when sizing a deployment.
--
-- The scaling assumes one usable core per worker. That holds where worker_processes
-- matches the cores actually available, which is the case with `auto` on an unrestricted
-- host. It does not hold under a CFS quota: nginx sets `auto` from the machine's online
-- CPU count, which sees neither a cgroup quota nor an affinity mask, so a container
-- capped below its host's core count gets the host's worth of workers and a budget
-- over-allocated by host_cores/limit. Verified: 12 workers and a 600 ms budget inside a
-- 1-CPU container on a 12-core host, where 5% would be 50 ms. If a CPU limit is ever
-- introduced, derive the budget from the quota rather than from ngx.worker.count().
--
-- What it bounds is derivation, which is the part that scales with ALTCHA_COST and the
-- part with no other limit on it. The rest of a mint - hex, JSON, one dict write - is
-- fixed work that a request pays whether or not it mints, and the probe does not time
-- it. So the budget is accurate where the derivation dominates (measured within 6% of a
-- real mint at cost 5000, exact at MAX_COST) and up to ~4x generous at a cost as low as
-- 100, where 0.02 ms of derivation sits inside a 0.07 ms mint. That is the safe
-- direction - a generous bound refuses nothing it should have served - and at costs
-- that low the absolute time is small regardless.

-- Refusals arrive at exactly the rate the flood does - measured at ~3,700 a second on

-- refusal tells the caller whether it has already been reported for this second, and
-- the caller stays quiet when it has. One line per worker per second, carrying the
-- count, rather than one per request.
--

-- the probe keeps minting until it has accumulated a span the clock can actually
-- resolve, then divides. PROBE_MIN_MS is that span; PROBE_MAX_MINTS stops a very fast

-- well under a millisecond; this ceiling keeps the worst case in the low tens.
--
-- That arithmetic is PBKDF2's, where the whole iteration count is spent inside one
-- native call. The SHA family spends it in a Lua loop instead - one FFI call into
-- final() and one into reset() per round - so the same number buys a fraction of the

-- and a bad SHA one - past the widget's timeout on a modest phone, and tens of
-- milliseconds of blocking per mint on our side.
--
-- Picked here rather than in config.lua's default_values on purpose: a default set
